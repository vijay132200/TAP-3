Replit Master Prompt: The Tacit Agent Platform (TAP)
PROJECT GOAL: Create a highly detailed, interactive web application that demonstrates how non-technical experts can easily build and govern an AI Agent based purely on their unique, specialized tacit knowledge (unwritten expert rules).

CORE FUNCTIONALITY: The system must validate that the agent prioritizes the expert's private judgment over general information.

RESOURCE MANDATE (Zero-Cost): To ensure minimal running costs, the system must utilize the best available free or low-cost, high-performance open-source models and resources (e.g., models available via the Hugging Face Hub, and free search APIs) for the reasoning engine, integrating them via the flexible LangChain framework.    

1. Required Application Components
The final web application must consist of three decoupled, high-value components:

Component	Purpose (Non-Technical Explanation)	Required Architecture
Autonomous Reasoning Engine	
The agent's "brain" that analyzes the user's question, decides the best course of action, and selects which tool to use.    

Must use a robust state-management framework (e.g., LangChain/LangGraph) to handle multi-turn conversations and reliably decide when to call the custom tool.    

Proprietary Knowledge Module	A highly specialized tool dedicated to consulting the expert's private knowledge base (the captured tacit judgment).	
Must be a custom-defined function that contains specialized heuristics (e.g., proprietary risk thresholds or communication styles) that the Reasoning Engine is instructed to prioritize.    

Visual Control Panel (UI)	
The web interface where the expert interacts with the agent and controls its behavior without touching any underlying code.    

Must be a simple, dynamic web application (e.g., Streamlit) with an explicit sidebar for governance controls.    

2. The 3-Step Agent Creation Process (Interactive Demo)
The web application must visually demonstrate the following three easy steps for a non-technical user:

Step	Action by the Non-Technical Expert (Visualized on Screen)	Outcome / Governance Mechanism
Step 1: Codify the Tacit Knowledge	The expert provides their unique rules and unwritten best practices (heuristics) via structured text input.	
These rules are embedded directly into the Proprietary Knowledge Module, making the agent's expertise highly specific and proprietary.    

Step 2: Govern the Agent's Brain	
The expert adjusts the System Prompt (the Agent's core instructions) using a large text box in the Visual Control Panel (sidebar).    

This changes the agent's tone, focus, and rule-following priority instantly, providing full behavioral control without code updates.
Step 3: Test and Enforce Safety	The expert enables the Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) toggle in the Control Panel.	
The agent is forced to pause and issue a clear warning (Visibility of System Status heuristic ) for any high-risk action (like applying a non-standard risk assessment), requiring expert confirmation before proceeding.    

3. Detailed Web Application Layout
Generate a clean, professional web application using a layout suitable for a quick deployment environment (like Streamlit).

A. Sidebar (Visual Control Panel)
Header: "Agent Governance (Expert Control)"

Component 1 (Text Area): Large input box for the System Prompt. (This is where the non-technical expert writes the agent's core rules and personality.)

Component 2 (Toggle Switch): Clearly labeled "Enable Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) Veto."

Component 3 (Button): "Reset Session" button to clear conversational memory.

B. Main Content Area (Chat Interface)
Header: "Tacit Agent Platform: Live Demonstration"

Display Area: A scrolling chat window to show the conversation history.

Interaction Indicator: Must clearly display when the agent is "Reasoning..." or "Consulting Tacit Knowledge..." to maintain user trust.    

Special Warning Display: If the HIL switch is active, a highly visible, colored box must appear in the chat stream when a high-risk scenario is triggered, demanding expert confirmation.

4. Execution Instructions (Non-Code)
Ensure the generated Python application is ready to run immediately upon opening the Replit environment.

The environment must be configured to use the necessary libraries (LangChain, Streamlit, etc.).

The system must rely on Replit Secrets for API authentication (for the open-source model endpoint and search tool), minimizing setup time.
